    Let ``S`` = the number of states, and ``A`` = the number of acions.
    Parameters
    ----------
    transitions : array
        Transition probability matrices. These can be defined in a variety of
        ways. The simplest is a numpy array that has the shape ``(A, S, S)``,
        though there are other possibilities. It can be a tuple or list or
        numpy object array of length ``A``, where each element contains a numpy
        array or matrix that has the shape ``(S, S)``. This "list of matrices"
        form is useful when the transition matrices are sparse as
        ``scipy.sparse.csr_matrix`` matrices can be used. In summary, each
        action's transition matrix must be indexable like ``transitions[a]``
        where ``a`` ∈ {0, 1...A-1}, and ``transitions[a]`` returns an ``S`` ×
        ``S`` array-like object.
    reward : array
        Reward matrices or vectors. Like the transition matrices, these can
        also be defined in a variety of ways. Again the simplest is a numpy
        array that has the shape ``(S, A)``, ``(S,)`` or ``(A, S, S)``. A list
        of lists can be used, where each inner list has length ``S`` and the
        outer list has length ``A``. A list of numpy arrays is possible where
        each inner array can be of the shape ``(S,)``, ``(S, 1)``, ``(1, S)``
        or ``(S, S)``. Also ``scipy.sparse.csr_matrix`` can be used instead of
        numpy arrays. In addition, the outer list can be replaced by any object
        that can be indexed like ``reward[a]`` such as a tuple or numpy object
        array of length ``A``.
    discount : float
        Discount factor. The per time-step discount factor on future rewards.
        Valid values are greater than 0 upto and including 1. If the discount
        factor is 1, then convergence is cannot be assumed and a warning will
        be displayed. Subclasses of ``MDP`` may pass ``None`` in the case where
        the algorithm does not use a discount factor.
    epsilon : float
        Stopping criterion. The maximum change in the value function at each
        iteration is compared against ``epsilon``. Once the change falls below
        this value, then the value function is considered to have converged to
        the optimal value function. Subclasses of ``MDP`` may pass ``None`` in
        the case where the algorithm does not use an epsilon-optimal stopping
        criterion.
    max_iter : int
        Maximum number of iterations. The algorithm will be terminated once
        this many iterations have elapsed. This must be greater than 0 if
        specified. Subclasses of ``MDP`` may pass ``None`` in the case where
        the algorithm does not use a maximum number of iterations.
    Attributes
    ----------
    P : array
        Transition probability matrices.
    R : array
        Reward vectors.
    V : tuple
        The optimal value function. Each element is a float corresponding to
        the expected value of being in that state assuming the optimal policy
        is followed.
    discount : float
        The discount rate on future rewards.
    max_iter : int
        The maximum number of iterations.
    policy : tuple
        The optimal policy.
    time : float
        The time used to converge to the optimal policy.
    verbose : boolean
        Whether verbose output should be displayed or not.
    Methods
